# Image Recognition with PyTorch




**Project intuition and reasoning:**

This is my first run-in with PyTorch. I built a Convolutional Neural Network to predict what digit is being displayed in an image. The dataset used for this is PyTorch's built in MNIST dataset that has 70k images. 

This is what an image looks like, here is the number 9:

**Project Overview**
- Create loaders and define layers
- Create a tensor
- Perform first convolution/activation and run pooling layer
- Perform second convolution/activation and run pooling layer
- Preprocessing
- Model creation/training
- Evaluate accuracy and check what images weren't correctly predicted


**Results**
Here are some of the images that could not be predicted... probably the work of a doctor.
